## Design and implementation of experiments related to computer architecture:
- 1) Design of a full adder at the gate abstraction level
- 2) Implementation of 4-bit comparator, 4-to-1 multiplexer, 4-to-2 encoder and 2-to-4 decoder
- 3) DFF, TFF design with asynchronous reset + Ripple Counter design, four bits using TFF
- 4) Sequence Detector (Implementation using Mealy and Moore mode machines)
- 5) Ripple Carry Adder + Carry-Lookahead Adder + Carry Select Adder (4-bit)
- 6) Design and implementation of BCD collector
- 7) Array multiplier + Multiplier using CSA
- 8) Shift & Add multiplier
- 9) Shift register with parallel input and serial output
- 10) Implementation of RAM, ROM, CAM
- 11) Implement a simplified version of the basic computer
